## Objectives
The aim of the project is to predict the bike count required at each hour for stable supply. It is important to make the rental bike available and accesible to public at right time and reduce waiting time for their mobility comfort.


## Project Desciption
**capstone_project.ipynb** - Include all function required to predict the bike sharing demand

**Technical_documentation.docx** - Include the documentation for the project.

This project is part of a **Capstone Project** by **Shashank Mishra**, aiming to predict bike-sharing demand using historical data and multiple machine learning models.

---

## 📊 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to accurately predict the number of bikes rented at a given time using various features such as:
- **Datetime information**: Season, month, hour, and day.
- **Weather conditions**: Temperature, humidity, and windspeed.
- **Special events**: Holidays and working days.

✅ The project uses machine learning models to identify demand patterns, helping bike rental companies optimize fleet management and resource allocation.

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**
- 🐍 **Python 3.8+**
- 📊 **Jupyter Notebook**
- 📈 **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- 🔥 **Scikit-Learn (ML Models)**
- 📚 **SHAP for model explainability**
